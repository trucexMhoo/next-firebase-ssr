# Introduction to Semiconductor Devices by Kevin F. Brennan: A Review
 
Introduction to Semiconductor Devices by Kevin F. Brennan is a textbook that covers the fundamentals and applications of semiconductor devices for computing and telecommunications. The book aims to provide a solid grounding in the most important devices used in the hottest areas of electronic engineering today, such as field effect transistors, lightwave and wireless devices, and future approaches to computing hardware and RF power amplifiers[^1^].
 
The book begins with a discussion of the basic properties of semiconductors, such as energy bands, carrier statistics, transport phenomena, and generation-recombination processes. Next, it introduces the structure, behavior, and operating requirements of various types of junctions, such as pn junctions, heterojunctions, Schottky barriers, and ohmic contacts. Then, it describes the state-of-the-art field effect devices, including metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOSFETs), metal-semiconductor field effect transistors (MESFETs), high electron mobility transistors (HEMTs), and modulation-doped field effect transistors (MODFETs). It also addresses the short channel effects and the challenges faced by continuing miniaturization of these devices. The rest of the book focuses on the semiconductor devices used in lightwave and wireless telecommunications systems, such as photodetectors, lasers, solar cells, microwave diodes, bipolar junction transistors (BJTs), heterojunction bipolar transistors (HBTs), and power amplifiers. The book concludes with a brief overview of some emerging trends and system demands of computing and telecommunications systems that influence the choice, design, and operation of semiconductor devices.

The book is intended for senior undergraduate and graduate students who have a background in basic electronics and solid state physics. It is also a valuable reference for engineers and researchers in the field of semiconductor devices. The book is well-written and organized, with clear explanations, examples, figures, tables, and problems. The book also includes a solutions manual that contains detailed solutions to selected exercises and problems[^2^]. The book covers a wide range of topics and devices that are relevant to modern electronic engineering applications. However, some readers may find the book too advanced or mathematical for an introductory course. Some topics or devices may also be outdated or omitted due to the rapid development of the field.
 
Overall, Introduction to Semiconductor Devices by Kevin F. Brennan is a comprehensive and authoritative textbook that provides a thorough understanding of the principles and applications of semiconductor devices for computing and telecommunications. It is suitable for students who want to learn more about the theory and practice of semiconductor devices, as well as for engineers and researchers who want to update their knowledge and skills in this field.
