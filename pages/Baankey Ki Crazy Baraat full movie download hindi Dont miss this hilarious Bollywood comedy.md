The film was released on 28 August 2015 and faced competition from other films like Phantom, Welcome Back and Manjhi - The Mountain Man. The film had a low opening at the box office and could not attract many viewers. The film collected around Rs. 3.95 crore in its lifetime run and was declared a disaster by Box Office India.
 
The film also received a lukewarm response from the critics, who found it to be outdated, predictable and unfunny. Some critics also pointed out the flaws in the script, direction and editing of the film.

Baankey Ki Crazy Baraat is a film that tried to cash in on the popularity of wedding comedies but failed to deliver on its promise. The film had a decent premise but lacked the execution and charm to make it a memorable comedy. The film is only recommended for those who are die-hard fans of Rajpal Yadav and his brand of comedy.
