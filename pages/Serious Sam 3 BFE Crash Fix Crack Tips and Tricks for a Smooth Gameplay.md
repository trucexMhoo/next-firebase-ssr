## Method 1: Update Your Drivers
 
One of the most common causes of game crashes is outdated or incompatible drivers. Drivers are software components that allow your hardware devices to communicate with your operating system and applications. If your drivers are not up to date or compatible with the game, you may experience performance issues, errors, or crashes.
 
To update your drivers, you can use a driver updater tool that can automatically scan your system and install the latest drivers for your devices. Alternatively, you can manually download and install the drivers from the official websites of your device manufacturers. Make sure you download the drivers that match your system specifications and operating system version.
 
## Method 2: Run the Game as Administrator
 
Another possible reason why the game crashes with crack is that it does not have enough permissions to access certain files or folders on your PC. This can happen if you have a strict security software or user account control settings. To fix this, you can try running the game as an administrator.
 
To run the game as an administrator, follow these steps:

To fix this, you can use Steam's built-in feature to verify the integrity of your game files. This will scan your game folder and replace any damaged or missing files with fresh ones.
 
To verify your game files integrity, follow these steps:

- Open Steam and go to your Library.
- Right-click on Serious Sam 3 BFE and select Properties.
- Go to the Local Files tab and click on Verify Integrity of Game Files.
- Wait for the process to complete and then launch the game.
