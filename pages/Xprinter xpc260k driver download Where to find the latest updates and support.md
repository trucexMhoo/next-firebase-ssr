## What is a thermal printer?
 
A thermal printer is a type of printer that uses heat to create images on paper. Unlike inkjet or laser printers, thermal printers do not require ink or toner cartridges. Instead, they use special paper that is coated with a chemical that changes color when exposed to heat. Thermal printers are fast, quiet, and cost-effective. They are widely used in various industries, such as retail, hospitality, healthcare, and transportation.
