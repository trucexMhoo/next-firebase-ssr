Whether you want to spice up your tracks with some taiko drums, African drums, Indian instruments, Balkan voices, Arabic voices, Persian voices, gongs, bells, cymbalum, or any other world sound, Ethno Instrument 2 has you covered. You can browse and search by category or geographic region, and easily load and play multisampled instruments or tempo-synced loops and phrases.
 
But what if you want to go beyond the traditional sounds and create something more experimental and edgy? Well, Ethno Instrument 2 also gives you the tools to do that. You can apply microtonal tuning and scales from around the world to any sound, or download and import free Scala-format microtuning files from the internet. You can also speed up, slow down, or tempo-match any loop or phrase using state-of-the-art time-stretching capabilities licensed from the famed IRCAM Audio Institute in Paris.
 
And if that's not enough, you can also tweak the sounds with Ethno Instrument 2's enhanced effects processing, which includes new analog-modeled EQ, CPU-optimized convolution reverb and eight new analog modeled filters. You can also layer and mix unlimited parts of instrument sounds, loops and phrases, and use keyswitch presets for ultra-expressive performance.
 
Ethno Instrument 2 is compatible with most DAW hosts and Mac/Windows operating systems, and supports 64-bit Windows 7. It can run as a stand-alone application or as a plug-in that saves all settings with your host software sessions. It is also compatible with Ethno Instrument 1, so you can load and play your existing projects with the new version.
 
So if you are a crack head who loves world music and wants to explore new sonic territories, you should definitely give Motu Ethno Instrument 2 a try. It is available for purchase or upgrade from authorized MOTU resellers or from MOTU's website[^1^] [^2^]. You can also watch a video interview with Teddy Riley, one of the most successful R&B producers of all time and a user of Ethno Instrument 2[^1^].
  
In this section, we will take a closer look at some of the features and sounds of Ethno Instrument 2. First, let's see how easy it is to load and play an instrument sound. You can either use the browser to find a sound by category or region, or use the search function to type in a name or keyword. For example, if you type in "flute", you will see a list of results that match your query. You can then click on any result to load it into the main window.
 
Once you have loaded a sound, you can play it from your MIDI keyboard or controller, or use the on-screen keyboard. You can also adjust the volume, pan, tune, and other parameters using the knobs and sliders. You can also access more advanced settings by clicking on the edit button. Here you can change the envelope, filter, LFO, modulation, and effects of the sound. You can also apply microtonal tuning and scales to any sound by clicking on the tuning button.
 
If you want to load a loop or phrase instead of an instrument sound, you can do that too. Ethno Instrument 2 comes with hundreds of authentic loops and phrases from various regions and genres. You can browse and search for them in the same way as instrument sounds. Once you have loaded a loop or phrase, you can play it back in sync with your host software tempo, or adjust the speed using the time-stretching function. You can also slice loops with one click to trigger each beat from your keyboard, or drag and drop them directly into your host software tracks.
