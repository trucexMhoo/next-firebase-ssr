The novel reveals the horrific fate of many Serbs who were kidnapped, tortured and killed in the so-called "Yellow House" in Burel, Albania, where their organs were harvested and sold to wealthy clients. Johan, who feels a strong connection to his donor's family and homeland, decides to travel to Kosovo and find out the truth about his new heart.

Srpsko Srce Johanovo was published in 2012 by Poeta, a Serbian association of writers. The book has received positive reviews from critics and readers, and has been translated into several languages. The book is available in PDF format online for free download.
  
The organ trafficking allegations have been strongly denied by Kosovo and Albania, who accuse Serbia and Russia of using them as a propaganda tool to undermine their sovereignty and reputation. The allegations have also been challenged by several human rights organizations, journalists and experts, who point out the lack of credible evidence and witnesses, as well as the inconsistencies and contradictions in the Marty report.
 
Despite the controversy, the Marty report led to the establishment of a special court in The Hague, known as the Kosovo Specialist Chambers and Specialist Prosecutor's Office (KSC), to investigate and prosecute crimes against humanity, war crimes and other crimes under Kosovo law allegedly committed by KLA members between 1998 and 2000. The court operates under Kosovo law but is staffed by international judges and prosecutors.
 
The KSC has so far issued 10 indictments against former KLA leaders and fighters, including Kosovo's current president Vjosa Osmani and former prime minister Hashim Thaci. The indictments charge them with various crimes, such as murder, torture, persecution and enforced disappearance of civilians, but do not mention organ trafficking. The defendants have pleaded not guilty and denounced the court as politically motivated and biased.
 
The trials at the KSC are expected to start in 2022, amid high tensions and expectations in the region. The court's verdicts could have significant implications for the fragile relations between Kosovo and Serbia, as well as for the prospects of reconciliation and justice for the victims of the war.
  
The organ trafficking allegations have also caused immense pain and frustration for the families of the victims, who are still waiting for answers and justice. According to the International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC), there are still 1,643 people unaccounted for as a result of the Kosovo war, most of them ethnic Albanians. The ICRC has urged all parties involved to intensify their efforts to clarify the fate and whereabouts of the missing persons, and to provide support and assistance to their relatives.
 
Some of the families have expressed their doubts and dissatisfaction with the Marty report and the KSC, saying that they are based on hearsay and speculation, and that they divert attention and resources from the real issues. They have also accused Serbia and Russia of exploiting their tragedy for political purposes, and of denying their right to self-determination and recognition.
 
On the other hand, some of the families have welcomed the Marty report and the KSC, hoping that they will shed light on the truth and bring closure to their suffering. They have also appealed to Kosovo and Albania to cooperate fully with the investigations and prosecutions, and to respect their human dignity and rights.
